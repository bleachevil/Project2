# PROJECT OVERVIEW

The initial goal of our project was to determine if twitter sentiments had an effect on Ethereum prices. As we analyzed our data and conducted a sentiment analysis on tweets from 2013-2021, we concluded there was no correlation between these tweets and Ethereum prices. 

We then set out to determine which features are corrrelated with Ethereum closing prices using various machine learning models.
